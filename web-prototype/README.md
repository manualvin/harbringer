## üìä Current Stats

- **File size:** ~20KB (single HTML file)
- **No dependencies:** Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Target FPS:** 60 (uses requestAnimationFrame)
- **Performance:** Smooth on any modern device
- **Mobile-friendly:** Touch controls not yet implemented

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Modify

### Change Debris Count
```javascript
// Line ~117: Initialize Debris Field
for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {  // Change 20 to desired count
```

### Adjust Flight Speed
```javascript
// Line ~192: Update Game Logic
const thrust = 0.3;  // Increase for faster acceleration
ship.maxSpeed = 20;  // Increase for higher top speed
```

### Modify Fuel Consumption
```javascript
// Line ~194
const fuelConsumption = 0.5;  // Lower = fuel lasts longer
```

### Change Colors
```css
/* Line ~16: Cockpit UI colors */
color: #0f0;  /* Green - change to any hex code */

/* For retro amber theme: */
color: #fa0;  /* Amber/orange */

/* For cyan theme: */
color: #0cf;  /* Cyan */
```

## üéØ What This Prototype Proves

### ‚úÖ Validated Concepts
1. **Flight feels good** - 6DOF movement is intuitive with WASD + arrows
2. **Space physics work** - Momentum and inertia create interesting gameplay
3. **Collision detection** - Can navigate debris field without being frustrating
4. **UI is readable** - Retro green aesthetic works, gauges are clear
5. **Performance is solid** - Runs at 60 FPS even with 20 debris + 200 stars

### üîÑ Next Iterations (Add to This File)
- [ ] **Scanning mechanic** - Point at debris, hold key to scan, progress bar
- [ ] **Detection system** - Meter fills when scanning (attracts threat)
- [ ] **Objectives** - "Scan 5 objects to proceed"
- [ ] **Sound effects** - Engine hum, collision, warnings (Web Audio API)
- [ ] **Mobile touch controls** - Virtual joysticks for phones/tablets
- [ ] **Better 3D** - Use Three.js for proper 3D models instead of squares
- [ ] **Pixel art cockpit** - Replace CSS UI with canvas-drawn retro graphics

---

## üöß Known Limitations

### Current Simplifications
- **2.5D rendering** - Not true 3D (no Z-rotation, simplified projection)
- **Debris are squares** - Should be angular 3D shapes
- **No roll control** - Ship can't roll (Z-axis rotation)
- **No atmospheric flight** - All phases use same physics
- **No landing** - Phase 2 mechanics not implemented
- **Static hull** - Damage system not connected yet

### Technical Debt
- Collision uses distance check (works but not precise for complex shapes)
- Radar blips don't account for ship rotation
- No state machine (all game logic in one loop)
- CSS UI doesn't scale perfectly on very small/large screens

---

## üì± Browser Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Tested & Working
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Not Supported
- Internet Explorer (lacks Canvas API features)
- Very old mobile browsers (iOS < 12, Android < 5)

## üîÑ Porting to Unity

Once mechanics feel good, port to Unity with these mappings:

### HTML Canvas ‚Üí Unity
```
HTML Canvas 2D            ‚Üí  Unity 3D Scene
CSS UI Overlay            ‚Üí  Unity UI Canvas
JavaScript game object    ‚Üí  C# ShipController
ctx.fillRect()            ‚Üí  GameObject with MeshRenderer
Keyboard input            ‚Üí  Input.GetKey() / New Input System
```

### Direct Code Equivalents
```javascript
// JavaScript
game.ship.vx += thrustX;
game.ship.x += game.ship.vx * dt;

// Unity C#
rb.AddForce(transform.right * thrustX);
// Rigidbody handles position automatically
```

## üé® Next Steps

### Week 1: Validate Core Loop (This Prototype)
- ‚úÖ Flight controls feel good?
- ‚úÖ Debris collision is fair?
- ‚úÖ UI is readable?
- ‚úÖ Performance is acceptable?

### Week 2: Add Gameplay
- [ ] Scanning mechanic (hold E on debris)
- [ ] Objective: "Scan 5/5 objects"
- [ ] Win condition (proceed to Phase 2)
- [ ] Simple audio (engine loop, collision sound)

### Week 3: Polish Web Version
- [ ] Replace squares with triangle-based 3D shapes
- [ ] Add particle effects (thruster exhaust)
- [ ] Implement proper retro color palette
- [ ] Mobile touch controls

### Week 4: Decide
- **Option A:** Keep building in JavaScript (use Three.js for 3D)
- **Option B:** Port to Unity (use this as reference)
- **Option C:** Build both (web demo + full iOS game)

## üí° Tips for Testing

### Feel Testing
1. **Thrust responsiveness** - Does W key feel snappy or sluggish?
2. **Rotation speed** - Can you aim at debris quickly enough?
3. **Momentum** - Does drifting feel natural or frustrating?
4. **Collision fairness** - Can you squeeze between debris or is it too tight?

### Tuning Values
If flight feels off, try these tweaks:
```javascript
// Too slow ‚Üí Increase thrust
const thrust = 0.5;  // Was 0.3

// Too floaty ‚Üí Increase drag (add this line after line 224)
ship.vx *= 0.98;  // 2% drag per frame
ship.vy *= 0.98;
ship.vz *= 0.98;

// Too fast ‚Üí Lower max speed
ship.maxSpeed = 15;  // Was 20
```
